\section*{Data Management Plan}

The data generated by the proposed research includes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software implementing an assessment system
\item The results of deploying the assessment system in one or more
  classes, including:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Assignments created by the instructor
\item Submissions by the students
\item Reviews performed by the students
\item Final assessments created by the grading staff
\item Other grading information
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

All of these data will be in textual format: computer code (Python,
Javascript) for the software, LaTeX for the assignments and the
student submissions, and various data files for the assessments and
grading.

All software will be made available on an open source basis.

Our ability to distribute student data will be determined by our IRB,
but we anticipate that we can provide
the above-listed information to other researchers,
with all identifying information about the students removed.
Instead, each student will be identified in the data by a unique
numeric identifier. 

We will maintain information about each course as a set of protected
files on the Andrew File System (AFS)\@.  We
will store the information in a way that we can disseminate the data
by simply copying and supplying some portion of the course directory
structure as a Unix Tar archive.  The directories will contain a set
of README files documenting the structure and format of the files.
Course directories are typically maintained for many years, and so we
anticipate being able to make this information available for at least
five years.  We do not believe the data will have much research value
beyond this point, because they will be obsolete by then.
